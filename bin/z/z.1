\fBFrecency:\fR
.P
Frecency is a portmantaeu of 'recent' and 'frequency'. It is a weighted rank
that depends on how often and how recently something occured. As far as I
know, Mozilla came up with the term.
.P
In \fBz\fR, a directory that has low ranking but has been accessed recently
will quickly have higher rank than a directory accessed frequently a long time
ago.
.br

.SH ENVIRONMENT
A function \fB_z()\fR is defined.
.P
An alias \fB$_Z_CMD\fR='_z 2>&1' is defined. If not set, \fB$_Z_CMD\fR defaults
to \fBz\fR.

.SH FILES
data is stored in \fB$HOME/.z\fR
